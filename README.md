## Prompt

Connecting with alumni from your college or university is often hard for students — finding alumni in the right industry or role, knowing how to reach out (especially if their contact information isn’t easily available), and how to foster a relationship with an alumni mentor are all problems universities have recognized their students face. Create a React, multi-paneled web application with that focuses on users swiping for jobs, with the sitemap provided as your basic structure. You are free to use either build a website or app, but either way, we require that you use react or react native. Any other libraries or frameworks you use are up to your discretion. 

## Technical Architecture:

Frontend Component:

By using React Native, I coded the user interface to present the 5 components O chose to implement from the sitemap. I also decided to include a simple settings page to go along with the app as I felt it most necessary.
