## Prompt

Connecting with alumni from your college or university is often hard for students — finding alumni in the right industry or role, knowing how to reach out (especially if their contact information isn’t easily available), and how to foster a relationship with an alumni mentor are all problems universities have recognized their students face. Create a React, multi-paneled web application with that focuses on users swiping for jobs, with the sitemap provided as your basic structure. You are free to use either build a website or app, but either way, we require that you use react or react native. Any other libraries or frameworks you use are up to your discretion. 

## Technical Architecture:

Frontend Component:

By using React Native, I coded the user interface to present the 5 components O chose to implement from the sitemap. I also decided to include a simple settings page to go along with the app as I felt it most necessary.

## individual components

Menu Bar: The menu bar on the bottom displays the three main components from the sitemap plus the added bonus of a settings page. Each of them have their own icon. Each ico takes you to the specific page as well. 

Messages Page: The Messages page has a send button and a text input bar for people to text and have it show up right above it. It also displays "Messages" on the top of it.

Feed Page: This page does not have any features incorporated. It does show company name at the very top because I imagine this is the first page people would see when opening up the app.

Profile Page: Shows a profile picture, name, sex, age, the current job/position of the user, as well as the profile header and bio.

Settings Page: Added bonus to the project. Although it only displays three potential settings' features, I am sure there are many more that could be added since it is a professional app.
